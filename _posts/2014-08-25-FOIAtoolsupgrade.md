| [Froide](http://stefanw.github.io/froide/) | Freedom of Information Laws and Public Entities are connected through a many-to-many relationship. That allows for a Public Body to be accountable under different laws.A Public Body can have a parent to represent hierarchies from the real world. They can also be categorized into classifications (e.g. ministry, council) and topical tags (e.g. environment, military) which can be defined separately.Users can create requests without a Public Body so that others can suggest an appropriate recipient later.Requests can optionally be kept private by users and published at a later point (e.g. after a related article has been published).Requests are mailed to Public Bodies through the platform via a special, request-unique email address (using SMTP) and the platform will receive answers on that mail address (by accessing an IMAP account).Search functionality for Requests and Public Bodies.A read/write REST-APIRedaction of PDFs | Froide 3.0 uses the popular Python Web framework Django and its ecosystem in themost up-to-date version 1.5.Froide is continuously tested with Python 2.6 and Python 2.7 on Travis CI including in-browser testing.Because it is built with latest Bootstrap it comes with a responsive design and is easily themeable.[Developer Documentation](http://froide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) | [FragDenStaat.de](https://fragdenstaat.de/) and[FragDenStaat.at](https://fragdenstaat.at/) - the German and Austrian FOI site |
