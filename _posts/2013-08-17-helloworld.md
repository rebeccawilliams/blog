I [tweet](www.twitter.com/internetrebecca), I put everything I've got into emails, I talk a lot, but blogging is something I used to enjoy and I wish I did more of. With admitedly some assistance from [Konklone, Inc.](www.konklone.com), I have set up the [Balzac theme for Jekyll](http://jekyll.gtat.me/about/) as clean space for no excuses. For historical purposes, I have rounded up my short history of weblogging. 

To date:

* ~2002-2004 Livejournal & Deadjournal. Diary, Stories. Retired, copy lost. 
* ~2008-2010 Blogspot. Things I was reading/listening to. Retired, copy lost. 
* 2013-2014 [Open Data Policy blogging with the Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/author/rwilliams/)
* 2010-present, a personal blogging hiadus with many one post tumblr attempts, see: 
	* [http://thesearewebcomicsiknow.tumblr.com/](These are web comics, I know.) 1st Tumblr, updated the most, I still think it is good. 
	* [http://songstoputyouinamood.tumblr.com/](Songs to put you in a mood.) Cathartic emo music list post break-up. 
	* [http://songstoputyouinamood.tumblr.com/](http://songstopickyouup.tumblr.com/) Same. 
	* [http://housingcrisissolutions.tumblr.com/](http://housingcrisissolutions.tumblr.com/) I am listing this for transparency purposes, I never added anything, but I had a lot of [delicious bookmarks](https://delicious.com/thisisdumbiknow).
	* [http://internetrebecca.tumblr.com/](http://internetrebecca.tumblr.com/) This is when I was getting ansty to post things, but I don't even like my twitter handle, so taking on the full persona felt weird. 
	* [http://todayrebeccalearned.tumblr.com/](http://todayrebeccalearned.tumblr.com/) I can't remember the password to this or how to log in. 
	* [http://repeatendlesslytoyourself.tumblr.com/](http://repeatendlesslytoyourself.tumblr.com/) This is newer and was meant to be a quotes list like Jack Cheng's quotes page that I loved so much back in 2004. 
	* [http://thetimballchallenge.tumblr.com/](http://thetimballchallenge.tumblr.com/) A cooking blog with one post to date.
* Now-? **[http://rebeccawilliams.us/blog](http://rebeccawilliams.us/blog)**

Needless to say, I am glad to have a spot once again.
