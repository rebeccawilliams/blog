I [tweet](www.twitter.com/internetrebecca), I put everything I've got into emails, I talk a lot, but blogging is something I used to enjoy and I wish I did more of. With admitedly some assistance from [Konklone, Inc.](https://konklone.com/), I have set up the [Balzac theme for Jekyll](http://jekyll.gtat.me/about/) as clean space for no excuses. For historical purposes, I have rounded up my short history of weblogging. 

To date:

~2002-2004 Livejournal & Deadjournal. Diaries, stories. Retired, copies lost.  

~2008-2010 Blogspot. Things I liked. Retired, copy lost.  

2013-2014 [Open Data Policy blogging with the Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/author/rwilliams/)  

2010-2014, a personal blogging hiadus with many one post tumblr attempts, see:  

* [These are web comics, I know.](http://thesearewebcomicsiknow.tumblr.com/) First tumblr, updated the most, I still think it is good.  
* [Songs to put you in a mood.](http://songstoputyouinamood.tumblr.com/) Cathartic emo music, post break-up.  
* [Songs to pick you up.](http://songstopickyouup.tumblr.com/) Same.  
*  [Housing Crisis Solutions](http://housingcrisissolutions.tumblr.com/) I am listing this for transparency purposes, I never added anything, but I had a lot of [delicious bookmarks](https://delicious.com/thisisdumbiknow/tag_bundle/PlanningThesis) and I wanted to solve the Housing Crisis, still do.   
* [internetrebecca (tumblr addition)](http://internetrebecca.tumblr.com/) This is when I was getting antsy to post things, but I don't even like my twitter handle, so taking on the full persona felt weird.  
* [Today Rebecca Learned](http://todayrebeccalearned.tumblr.com/) I can't remember the password to this or how to log in. Not a joke or metaphor.  
* [Repeat Endlessly to Yourself](http://repeatendlesslytoyourself.tumblr.com/) This is newer and was meant to be a quotes list like [Jack Cheng](http://jackcheng.com/)'s [Notes to Self](https://web.archive.org/web/20090317095650/http://jackcheng.tumblr.com/) that I loved so much back in 2009.  
* [The Timball Challenge](http://thetimballchallenge.tumblr.com/) A cooking blog with one post to date.  

2014-? **[rebeccawilliams.us/blog](http://rebeccawilliams.us/blog)** 

Needless to say, I am glad to have a spot once again.
