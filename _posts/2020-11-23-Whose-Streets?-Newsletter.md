As part of Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs’ [Technology and Public Purpose (TAPP) Project](https://www.belfercenter.org/project/technology-and-public-purpose), [Rebecca Williams](/) is spending the 2020-21 academic year [assessing risks to civil liberties posed by “smart city” technologies](https://www.belfercenter.org/person/rebecca-williams/publication) and developing recommended interventions for the public, governments, and vendors.

To support this research, Rebecca and [Madeleine Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/madeleinewsmith) are gathering recent news and media related to “smart city” (and other) surveillance technologies of public spaces into one fun-size bundle for your inbox. The goals of this newsletter are to take you along on our journey of examining how “smart city” technology contributes to and interplays with the surveillance of public spaces and to inspire you to consider: “Whose Streets?”
